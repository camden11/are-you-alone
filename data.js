  "You are standing on a beach by yourself. You feel warm sand beneath your toes. The sun is setting behind the water. You breathe in deeply and smell the salty ocean air. You have wanted to be alone for a while to collect your thoughts, and you have finally gotten that chance.<br><br>Are you alone?",
  // 2
  "Your shadow lengthens as you watch the sun set. A slight breeze toys with your hair. It relaxes you. You breathe in deeply again. You came out here to get away from the stress and people in your life.<br><br>Are you alone?",
  // 3
  "The sun gradually disappears and the sky begins to dim. The sand darkens around your feet and it grows a bit colder.<br><br>Are you alone?",
  // 4
  "The waves start to crash louder now. You can tell that the tide is coming in. You look to your left and see two ships on the horizon.<br><br>Are you alone?",
  // 5
  "You look to the right, and see that the horizon is empty in this direction. The ocean here seems serene, and you are calmed by this. All of a sudden, you see a bright light flash in the distance. It flashes five times, and then disappears.<br><br>Are you alone?",
  // 6
  "You watch the horizon, expecting to see another flash of light. It does not reappear. You keep watch for a few minutes, but see nothing.<br><br>Are you alone?",
  // 7
  "The ocean grows louder as that tide comes in, and the sky is nearly completely dark now. You start to think it may be time to head home.<br><br>Are you alone?",
  // 8
  "As you turn to walk back, you notice the outline of a large object on the beach, about 200 yards away. You swear it hadn't been there before.<br><br>Are you alone?",
  // 9
  "Curious, you walk towards the shape. It's about the size of a car, and appears to be made of rusted metal.<br><br>Are you alone?",
  // 10
  "Suddenly, you hear what sounds like the creak of rusty metal moving. All else is quiet, aside from the ocean, and you determine that it's coming from the object. You cautiously take a step back.<br><br>Are you alone?",
  // 11
  "The grating noise continues, then stops suddenly. You hold your breath.<br><br>Are you alone?",
  // 12
  "You hear a loud clang, and let your breath out without thinking. The metallic noise returns, louder this time. You see what seems like the surface of the object rotating and scraping against itself.<br><br>Are you alone?",
  // 13
  "You look closer, ever so carefully. The front of the object is some kind of hatch, and it is slowly opening. You wait, completely frozen but unable to look away. The shape of a foot emerges from the object.<br><br>Are you alone?",
  // 14
  "The shape of a human emerges from the object, and stares, motionless, in your direction.<br><br>Are you alone?",
  // 15
  "The mysterious person takes a few steps forward. You squint to get a better look, and let out a gasp. The person looks exactly like you. It has your face, your body, and is even wearing the clothes you are wearing right now. You take a step closer. The person is staring at you with a slight smile on its face.<br><br>Are you alone?",
  // 16
  "A huge wave crashes on the shore to your left, and startled, you glance towards the ocean. When you look back, both the person and the object are gone. You are alone on the beach, and you're thankful to be. Did you really just see yourself? You don't think you'll ever know for sure. You begin to make your way home.<br><br><br><br>The end.",

  "You are not alone. You hear footsteps. They are muffled by the sound of the ocean, but you can tell someone is rushing quickly towards you. Before you can fully turn around, your entire body erupts in pain. You no longer have the strenght to stand up. Your knees buckle, and you collapse face first in the sand. You feel warm as everything fades to black.",

  "The light flashes again, this time much closer to the shore. And then again, on the shoreline. A dense fog begins to roll in from the ocean, and you hear footsteps, but you cannot tell from which direction. You are not alone. The light flashes again, this time right in front of you. Before you can react, your entire body erupts in pain. You no longer have the strength to stand up, and you collapse in the sand. As your vision fades to black, you see a familiar figure standing where the light last flashed. You feel like you recognize them from somewhere, but you no longer care.",

  "You are not alone. You hear a loud clang, and the shadowy figure of a human being emerges from some sort of door on the front of the object. The figure immediately starts sprinting in your direction. You turn and run, but it doesn't take you long to realize that you have no chance of outrunning the mysterious being. You hear footsteps and heavy breathing behind your back, getting closer and closer to you. Suddenly, you are tackled to the ground and a white hot pain spreads throughout your body. As your vision fades to black, you hear your assailant say something. You can't make out what it is, but you recognize the voice as your own.",

The tide continues to creep in, and a dense fog begins to roll over the beach. You begin to run, but quickly lose sense of direction in the fog. The sound of creaking starts to come from all directions. You see a figure through the fog, and turn around, only to see another. You trip and fall as they close in on you, the creaking sound unbearably loud. Now unable to see in the fog, pain engulfs your body. Somehow, you hear your own voice speaking calmly over your screams. Everything fades to black.",

  "You are not alone. You turn to run, only to see that a second, identical looking human figure is standing in your path behind you. There is nowhere you can go. Your head begins to ache and you suddenly feel extremely weak. As you struggle to remain standing, the two figures begin walking towards you. You collapse to the ground, looking up to see not one, but three figures ahead of, all walking closer. You realize, to confusion, that each one is dressed exactly the same as you. Before you can react, intense pain pervades your body and your vision begins to fade to black.",

  "You are not alone. You are staring at yourself across the beach. Confused, you begin to panic, but in every direction you turn, you see another version of yourself. A dense fog rolls in, and the ocean begins to roar. Your doppelgangers all walk toward you, closing in. They are saying something to you, but you can't make it out over the sounds of the waves. They are holding knives. Helpless, you succumb to yourself."
